# What it does

- This website mainly constitutes of 2 modes:
  - Racing mode, where you get to race against a self-driving car that was taught how to drive using neural networks.
  - Learning mode, where you get to train your self-driving car by simulating hundreds of cars with different neural networks and saving the best one into your LocalStorage to use it on the next race or learning session, more info is given in the [website](https://github.com/psycho-baller/self-driving-car) for how to play with this mode

- Please [connect with me](#connect-with-me) if you have any good ideas to improve this project in any way.

# Technologies used (tech stack)

- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** a fast, fun, and friendly web framework.
  - 1st time using it.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** to create a type-safe JS code.

# Future plans

- [ ] about section
- [ ] footer
- [ ] make multiple maps (car positions) and the self-driving car's respective neural network for that map
- [ ] make neural networks for float AI speeds (currently it's only integers between 3-6)
- [ ] save data (neural networks for each speed and map) to a database instead of a file and localStorage
- [ ] phone compatability
- [ ] in the far future, it could possibly be more interactive and people can share their maps and self-driving cars with their neural networks for other people to try them out
